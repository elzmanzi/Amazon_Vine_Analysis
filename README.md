# Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:
The Purpose of this analysis is to analyse data with PySpark, create a Database in AWS and connect it to PgAdmin, as our dataset is huge, we used PySpark 
to perform ETL process. 
Results:
  - with the unpaid and paid program reviews, the results are shown below
  - ![Total umber of paid reviews by star rating]()

Summary:
in closing, with the analysis we made, i may suggest to look deeper of how the reviews were before paying for 5 star reviews, what is the difference in percentages. I can coclude by saying that in the data there is positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program.
